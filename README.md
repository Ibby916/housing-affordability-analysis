# Analyzing the Relationship of Housing-Related Factors in Various  Regions and  Locations, and Their Impact on Housing Affordability

The housing landscape in the United States is shaped by dynamic factors, including regional disparities, locational variations, and household demographics. Housing affordability remains a critical issue, especially with the growing cost burden for many households. This project aims to comprehend the intricate relationship between various housing-related factors such as household size, age, location, region, cost burden, household income, and assistance and their impact on housing affordability. The analysis aims to provide valuable insights for policymakers, housing developers, and other stakeholders to design strategies that would enhance housing affordability and accessibility.

## Dataset Description
This project utilizes the **Housing Affordability Data System (HADS)**, a comprehensive dataset derived from the **American Housing Survey (AHS)**. The dataset includes:
- Housing cost data for renters and owners, covering monthly expenses such as rent, mortgage, and utilities.
- Affordability metrics based on Area Median Income (AMI), Fair Market Rent (FMR), and poverty thresholds.
- Variables related to housing adequacy, utility costs, household income, and more.

## Objectives
1. **Regional and Locational Affordability**: 
   - Investigate cost burden distributions across different regions for both renters and owners.
   - Examine how the location (city center vs. suburbs) impacts overall housing affordability.
2. **Housing Adequacy and Cost Relationships**: 
   - Explore the relationship between perceived housing adequacy and cost burdens.
   - Identify specific cost-related patterns associated with different adequacy categories
3. **Assisted vs. Non-Assisted Housing Affordability**:
   - Compare the affordability of assisted housing units to non-assisted units
4. **Household Dynamics and Affordability**: 
   - Analyze the relationship between utility costs and housing
burden based on household size and available bedrooms.
   - Investigate how household size influences the affordability of
housing, especially in top burden categories.
   - Examine how the burden of housing costs changes with the age
of the head of the household.
